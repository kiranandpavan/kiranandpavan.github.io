							<h2>Our Story</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Pavan and I first talked in February 2017. Neither of us was convinced with the idea of an arranged marriage, but we decided to give it a shot. We sure are glad to do so.</p>

							<p>Our first conversation was definitely a bit awkward for the both of us. A couple of calls later I knew there is something different with him and our conversations became more interesting. Fortunately, Pavan seemed to develop similar feelings too. Days passed by, we were talking and texting all the time we can grab. In a couple of months, we felt strongly about our relationship and we finally met at the end of May 2017.</p>

							<p>Then at start of July, we planned a short trip to Bangalore, for my convocation. Now, I am so glad, he was able to join me. There was a moment we discovered ourselves and thatâ€™s the point we realised we were meant to be together. Well I can say, we are lucky to have found each other!</p>

							<p>Things were moving so fast and everything was falling into place. We got engaged on 23rd of July 2017 and we are getting hitched on October 6th, 2017. Cannot wait any longer to spend rest of my life with this charming person (as he claims, and ofcourse I agree :) )</p>
